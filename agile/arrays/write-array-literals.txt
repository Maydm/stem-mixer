We can also write arrays as array literals. In this manner, we can declare and define
arrays in a single line. This can be a more effecient way of writing arrays if you 
know all the values to begin with.

Remember, the length of an array cannot be changed once defined, but the values inside
of the array can be changed.

Practice by typing out the code below.

public class DeclareArrayLiterals {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String[] cities = {"Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay"};
        // This array holds three strings.

        // Now let's write an array of integers
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128};

        // Access elements in an array with bracket notation
        System.out.println(cities[0]);
        System.out.println(cities[2]);

        // TODO: Access the first, second, and last elements in the array "numbers"


        // Let's change the values in the arrays
        cities[0] = "Chicago";
        cities[1] = "St. Paul";
        // TODO: Change the third element to a new city in the cities array.

        // TODO: Change the third, fourth, and fifth elements in the numbers array.


    }
}


 What now? 


 What happens if you try to place a string in the numbers array?

 What will happen if you place an integer in the strings array?

 What about adding a double or a float to the numbers array?

 Write your own array in this new way.
