Let's write a help system. After all, programs are meant to make
our life easier right! SO once we know how to code we can begin
writing scripts and programs to do all sorts of things for us.
For example, you can write a program to open your web browser to your
favorite website, or a program to farm experience points in your 
favorite video game. 

But for starters, let's write a program that will help remind us of 
proper Java syntax.

Type out the code below in a new java file.

class HelpSystem {
    public static void main(String args[])
        throws java.io.IOException {
        char choice;

        System.out.println("What would you like help on:");
        System.out.println("   1. if");
        System.out.println("   2. switch");
        System.out.print("Choose one: ");

        choice = (char) System.in.read();

        switch(choice) {
            case '1':
                System.out.println("The if:\n");
                System.out.println("if (condition) statement;");
                System.out.println("else statement");
                break;
            case '2':
                System.out.println("The switch:\n");
                System.out.println("switch (expression) {");
                System.out.println("  case constant:");
                System.out.println("    statement sequence");
                System.out.println("    break;");
                System.out.println("  // ...");
                System.out.println("}");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.print("Selection not found.");
        }
    }
}

What now?

1) Write a third case that explains the syntax for creating an array
   or one of the other fundamental coding concepts that you've 
   learned in the past few days.

2) Go back to PrintSubjects.java and the "throws java.io.IOExeption {}"
    statement so the user can have a choice in what subject area they'days
    like to study. This will be a little challenging because you'll need
    to move your block of code inside of the new curly brackets. Use the 
    HelpSystem.java as a template.

3) Go back to the subject matter nested switch program that you created 
   and add the ability for a user to input their own choices.
