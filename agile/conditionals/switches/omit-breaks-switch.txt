Let's build a switch with breaks in it. Type out the program below.

// Omit breaks within multiple cases to display additional information

public class OmitBreaksSwitch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int month = 1;
        String monthType;
        String monthString;

        switch (month) {
            case 1:
                monthString = "January";
                break;
            case 2:
                monthString = "February";
                break;
            case 3:
                monthString = "March";
                break;
            case 4:
                monthString = "April";
                break;
            case 5:
                monthString = "May";
                break;
            case 6:
                monthString = "June";
                break;
            case 7:
                monthString = "July";
                break;
            case 8:
                monthString = "August";
                break;
            case 9:
                monthString = "September";
                break;
            case 10:
                monthString = "October";
                break;
            case 11:
                monthString = "November";
                break;
            case 12:
                monthString = "December";
                break;
            default:
                monthString = "Invalid month";
        }
        switch (month) {
            case 12:
            case 1:
            case 2:
                monthType = "Winter";
                break;
            case 3: 
            case 4:
            case 5:
                monthType = "Spring";
                break;
            case 6:
            case 7:
            case 8:
                monthType = "Summer";
                break;
            case 9:
            case 10:
            case 11:
                monthType = "Autumn";
                break;

            default:
                monthType = "Invalid monthType";
        }
        System.out.println(monthString + " is in the " + monthType);
    }
}

What now?

Using this file as a template, create a new java file called 
WeekWeekendSwitch and write a program that uses a switch
to display the day of the week and omits breaks to return if the 
day is a weekday or weekend. 

Avoid coping and pasting the days of the week switch you just made
so that you get lots of practice writing switches.

It might seem repititous, and that's because it is, but it will
also help cement the critical coding concepts and help you learn
faster, ultimately.
