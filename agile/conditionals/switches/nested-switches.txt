Next, we'll build a program called "PrintSubjects"

This uses nested switch statements which means 
we write a switch inside of another switch.
You could think of it as a baby kangaroo inside the 
pouch of a mother kangaroo. 

This first program begins with default switch values. 
Type the code below, compile, fix errors, run, and then change 
the values to see what different return results you can create.


class PrintSubjects
{
    public static void main(String arg[])
    {
        char branch = 'M'; // C - CSE, E - ECE, M - Mech // Edit the character to see different options
        int year = 3; // Edit the year for different options
        
        switch( year )
        {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("English, Maths, Drawing");
                break;
            case 2:
                switch( branch ) // LINE C
                {
                    case 'C':
                        System.out.println("Data structures, Java, Computer Organization");
                        break;
                    case 'E':
                        System.out.println("Micro processors, Logic switching theory");
                        break;
                    case 'M':
                        System.out.println("Drawing, Manufacturing Machines");
                        break;
                }
                break;
            case 3:
                switch( branch ) // LINE D
                {
                    case 'C':
                        System.out.println("Operating System, RDBMS");
                        break;
                    case 'E':
                        System.out.println("Fundamentals of Logic Design, Microelectronics");
                        break;
                    case 'M':
                        System.out.println("Internal Combustion Engines, Mechanical Vibration");
                        break;
                }
                break;
            // Add a fourth case with new switch options
        }
    
    }
}

What's next?

Using this program as a template, write your own nested switch
statement. The subject can be on sports, video games, school subjects,
animals or actors or anything that can be categorized and subcategorized.

Avoid copying and pasting. You'll learn faster and more permanently if
you type the code out yourself.
