If statements help developers write conditional statements.
That means we will ask the computer to do something when 
something else happens or if something is true or false.

Remember booleans? We use booleans quite a bit with 
if statements. 

You probably use conditionals every day in your own life,
whether you think of them or not. Consider your thoughts 
while you were trying to leave the house today.

What were some steps you needed to complete before you 
could go out-of-doors?

You probably needed to get dressed, perhaps take a shower
(the person sitting next to you hopes so!), brush your 
teeth and maybe have a little breakfast. Then you needed
to put on your shoes. And all of these individual actions 
have their own conditionals. 

Take tying your shoes, for example. Before you can tie your
shoes you need to put them on your feet. Before you can put 
them on your feet you may have needed to untie them, first.
If you kicked them off your feet before untying them the 
previous night. Then, finally, once your shoes are on
your feet and can tie them. To tie your shoes, you execute
an algorithm that you memorized as a child, but we may
be getting ahead of ourselves.

Finally, once you've met all the conditions for leaving the 
house you can execute your "walk out the door" algorithm.

Before we write anything that complicated, we'll start with
very simple conditionals that check if two numbers are
equal, less than or greater than. 

Let's build our first if statement.

Create a new java file and type the following program. Then
compile, fix any mistakes, and run the program a few times
to get a sense of how the if statement operates. 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class IfStatementIntroduction {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        boolean boolA, boolB;
        double x, y;
        
        System.out.print( "Enter the first number: " );
        x = keyboard.nextDouble();
        System.out.print( "Enter the second number: " );
        y = keyboard.nextDouble();
        
        if (x == y) {
            System.out.println( x + " and " + y + " are equal." );
        } else if (x > y) {
            System.out.println( x + " is greater than " + y );
        } else {
            System.out.println( x + " is less than " + y );
        }
    }
}


What now?

Run the code a few times to get a feel for how the program works.
