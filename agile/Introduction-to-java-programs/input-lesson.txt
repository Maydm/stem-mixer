It's time to allow the user to input data. Type this and run the program:

import java.util.Scanner; // Allows us to input information into the program

public class InputLessonOne {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); // Creates and names a scanner object
                
        System.out.println( "What is your name?" );
        keyboard.next();
        
        System.out.println( "What is 4 less than 71?" );
        keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println( "Enter a number between 0.0 and 1.0." );
        keyboard.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.println( "What have you learned today?" );
        keyboard.next();
    }
}

When we run the program you'll see that the program pauses after printing the 
first line. The blinking cursor is a prompt for you to enter information.

Play with different answers. What happens if you type a string into the second
or third questions? What happens if you enter a decimal number into the second 
question or an integer into the third?

Remember to compile the program we'll enter `javac InputLessonOne.java`
After the program compiles run the code with `java InputLessonOne`

What now?
1) Ask your own question

2) What happens if you answer number questions with letters? What happens if you 
answer word questions with numbers? Can you guess the reasons for the answers?
