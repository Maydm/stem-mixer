Let's see how indexOf() works with a short program. Type out this program
into a new Java program.

public class IndexOfString {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        String statement = "Maydm is Made By Them, My Maydm is Made By Me! I'm learning to code in Java!";
        int position = statement.indexOf("Maydm");
        int location = statement.indexOf("Made");
        int spot = statement.indexOf("Rockin!");

        System.out.println("Position of Maydm: " + position); // returns position of first occurance of Maydm
        System.out.println("Position of Made: " + location); // returns first position of first iteration of Made
        System.out.println("Position of Rockin!" + spot); // Doesn't exist, returns -1
        System.out.println("the first '!' is at position " + statement.indexOf("!"));
        System.out.println(statement.indexOf("maydm")); // Are you surprised by the returned value?
    }
}

What now?
