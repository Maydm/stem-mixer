Let's play with the methods toLowerCase() and toUpperCase().
Create a new Java file and type out the program below then work through
the What now exercises.

public class CaseChanger {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String question = "WHY ARE YOU YELLING?";
        String answer = "I'm not yelling";

        System.out.println(question.toLowerCase());
        System.out.println(answer.toUpperCase());
        System.out.println(question); // Is this still lowercase or is it uppercase now?
    }
}

What now?

When you run the program is the third print statement in lowercase or all caps?
What is the reason for the answer?

Add a new String and print it as being all uppercase and all lowercase.

How can we save the state of a string as all upper or lowercase?
