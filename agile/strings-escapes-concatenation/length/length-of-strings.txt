Let's practice using the length method. Retype this program, fix compile
errors and then run the app a few times to see how your answers are returned.
You'll notice we're typing out an if statement in the middle of this program.
We haven't covered this, so don't worry about it too much yet. We'll work
through an introduction to conditional statements soon and learn more about
how if and else if ladders work. 

You may also notice we use the method nextLine() instead of the next() method
we have used previously. This is so users can include spaces in their inputs
without breaking the program. Play with the difference yourself to see firsthand.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class LengthString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        String fName = "Jane";
        String lName = "Doe";
        System.out.print("What is your first name? ");
        fName = keyboard.nextLine();
        System.out.print("What is your last name? ");
        lName = keyboard.nextLine();
        String fullName = fName + " " + lName;

        System.out.println("The length of your first name is " + fName.length() + " charcaters.");
        System.out.println("The length of your last name is " + lName.length() + " characters.");
        System.out.println("The length of your full name is " + (fullName.length() - 1) + " characters");

        if (fullName.length() <= 10) {
            System.out.println("Wow, your full name is " + (fullName.length() - 1) + " characters. \nThat must have made printing your name in kindergarden easier");
        } else if (fullName.length() >= 25) {
            System.out.println("Wow, your name is " + (fullName.length() - 1) + " characters. \nThat must take a lot of ink to write out.");
        }

        String a = "a";
        String nothing = "";
        String abc = "abc";

        System.out.println("The length of \"" + a + "\" is " + a.length());
        System.out.println("The length of \"" + nothing + "\" is " + nothing.length());
        System.out.println("The length of \"" + abc + "\" is " + abc.length());

        // What happens if you try to use Char a instead of String a?
        // what happens if you try to name String nothing as String null?
    }
}

What now?

Try out the commented suggestions at the end of the program.

If you haven't played with the methods next() and nextLine() yet to
see their differences then do so now.

Why do we subtract one from the fullName.length() method?
If you're not sure, try removing the -1 in the program to see the difference 
in the printed output.
