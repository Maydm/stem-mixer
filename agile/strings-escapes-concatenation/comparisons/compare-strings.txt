Java allows us to compare two strings for equality.
Let's write a program that allows us to test the equality of a few
different strings.

Retype the program below into a new java file.

public class CompareStrings {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String wordOne = "Something different";
        String wordTwo = "Same";
        String wordThree = "Same";
        String wordFour = "SAME";

        System.out.println("Is \"" + wordOne + "\" the same as \"" + wordThree + "\" ?");
        System.out.println(wordOne.equals(wordTwo));
        System.out.println("Is \"" + wordTwo + "\" the same as \"" + wordThree + "\" ?");
        System.out.println(wordTwo.equals(wordThree));
        System.out.println("Is \"" + wordThree + "\" the same as \"" + wordFour + "\" ?");
        System.out.println(wordThree.equals(wordFour));
    }
}

Notice that in the method statement "wordOne.equals(wordTwo)"
we are comparing two String variables to one another.
The first element, that is "wordOne" is our first variable. "equals" is
the name of the method that we are invoking.
The last element, "wordTwo" is inside the parenthesis and is being
compared against the first element, the variable "wordOne".

We could write pseudocode notation as 
firstVariable.equals(secondVariable);

What now?
Create your own String variables and write a statement to compare them
to one another.
