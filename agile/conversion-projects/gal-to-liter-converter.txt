You've had quite a bit of practice thinking through how to build conversion
recipies for temperatures and measurements of distance. Those programs asked
for user inputs. We can also use Java to build tables. So rather than asking 
a user for a specific value, we can create a program that will automatically
print a given range of values.

Rather than giving you the code outright this time, you'll need to think
about the program requirements and how you'll structure the program.

Here's a few things you should know. 

1) This program will look similiar to the FtoCeLooper
2) We'll need variables for Gallons and Liters
3) Since we are looping we'll need a counter variable
4) You'll need a for loop and an if statement inside of that loop such
   that an empty line is printed every 10th line. This will make the output
   easier to read.
5) You should also know that you should have fun with this! If you start
   to feel very frustrated take a short break.
6) It's OK to Google for help. That's part of being a developer.
7) It's also OK to look at the FtoCeLooper, but try to think about this new
   program for a few mintues before you go right to it.
   

Good luck!!

   
Did you finish? Great work!! So...

   
What now?

1) Could you refactor the code to ask the user for the range of gallons they'd
like to convert to liters? What would be required to make that happen?
Think about it for a moment...

First thing, we'd want to import the Scanner class. What else?
Create new variables for the keyboard inputs...
Then use those variables, but where?
In the loop would be a good place to use them, right...

Gather your thoughts together in your notebook or journal and then let's do this!

2) Build a new and similar program that converts Liters to Gallons from 1L to 100L
using a for loop.

3) Refactor the Liters to Gallons converter to ask the user for their desired range.
