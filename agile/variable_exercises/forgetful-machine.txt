Let's take a step back and get a little more practice with inputs. Type out the 
program below letter for letter. Can you figure out what to call this file on 
your own?

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ForgetfulMachine {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println( "What city is the capital of France?" );
        keyboard.next();
        
        System.out.println( "What is 6 multiplied by 7?" );
        keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println( "Enter a number between 0.0 and 1.0." );
        keyboard.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.println( "Is there anything else you would like to say?" );
        keyboard.next();
    }
}

What now?

here to make a few changes.
