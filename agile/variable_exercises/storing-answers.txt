In the previous exercise we asked the user for input on their keyboard. 
What do you think happened to the answers you supplied the program?
Were they stored anywhere in memory?
No! We didn't add any variables, only keyboard input parameters.

Let's enable our next program to store the answers we provide it.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class StoringAnswers {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        String firstName;
        String lastName;
        int age, height, grade;
        double wages;
        
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print( "Enter your first name. " );
        firstName = keyboard.next();
        
        System.out.print( "Ok, thank you " + firstName + ". What is your last name? " );
        lastName = keyboard.next();
        
        System.out.print( "So your name is " + firstName + " " + lastName + ". Is that correct? " );
        keyboard.next();
        
        System.out.println( "How old are you " + firstName + " " + lastName + "?" );
        age = keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println( "How tall are you in inches?" );
        height = keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print( "Wow! " + height + " inches! Amazing. " );
        System.out.println( "Ok, what grade will you be in next school year?" );
        grade = keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print( "Last question. How much money, in dollars and cents, would you like to earn after graduation? " );
        wages = keyboard.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.println( "Keep learning to expand your comfort zone and you just may earn " + wages + "!" );
    }
}

This time, after answering the questions, the variables are stored into the program
so we can reuse them. 

What now?

1) After successfully running the program add a new variable and ask your own question.
2) How can you break your program by entering incorrect or unexpected primitive types?     
        
3) Now that you have experience storing user answers in variables, go back to the 
ForgetMachine program and fix it so that the program can store user answers with
appropriately typed variables.
