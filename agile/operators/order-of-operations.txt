There's no better way to find out how a program might behave
than to play with it and see what happens when we write
our code in slightly different ways.

Coding is NOT for the stodgy and overly catious. It 
requires creativity and a willingness to fail and learn
from one's mistakes. (Be catious when it comes to user
safety and when you're asked to violate good ethics,
but be bold when educating yourself).

public class OrderOfOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 4;
        int result = x++ / 2 + 3 * 3 - 1 / 2;
        System.out.println(result);
        int secondResult = x++ / 2 + 3 * (3 - 1) / 2;
        System.out.println(secondResult);
        int y = 6;
        int answer = y-- * 4 % 3 + 6 / 2;
        System.out.println(answer);
        int secondAnswer = y-- * 4 % 3 + (6 / 2);
        System.out.println(secondAnswer);
    }
}

What now?

Write your own expression using a variety of order of operations.
What's the result of your work? Do you always receive the 
same output or is it different based on how operations are ordered?
What does the answer to this question imply about
programming larger projects?
