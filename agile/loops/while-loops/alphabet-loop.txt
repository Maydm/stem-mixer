Loops can do more than numbers. We can also use Loops
to iterate through non-numerical values, such as the
alphabet.

Create a new java file and give it a try.

class AlphabetLoop {
    public static void main( String args[] ) {
        char ch = 'a';

        while (ch <= 'z') {
            System.out.print(ch + " ");
            ch++;
        }
        System.out.println(" ");
    }
}

What now?

1) Can you refactor (that means to revise) this program 
   such that it begins at the character 'z' and decrements
   down to the character 'a'?
