Let's begin with a very simple loop.
We'll create a for loop.
A for loop takes three conditions:
1) A starting value
2) A condition to operate under
3) A value to increment or decrement by

Often, but not always, a for loop will begin at a
value of 1, will count up to or down to a specified value and
increment or decrement by 1. We use a "++" to increment by 
one value at a time or "--" to decrement down one value at a time.

This loop starts at one, loops until the count variable
is less than or equal to 10 and increments by one integer
at a time. In each iteration, the loop will print the value
of the variable "count"

Type the code below in a new java program:

public class CountTenLoop {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        int count;
        
        for (count =1; count <= 10; count++) {
            System.out.println( "The count is: " + count );
        }
    }
}

Now what?

1) Change the count variable to equal a number more than 10.
   What happens when you run the code?

2) Change the second condition in the for loop. Change the 
   operation. Try using the greater than symbol or "==" for 
   equal to. 
   Can you make an infinite loop? (Note, you don't usualy
   want to write an infinite loop. If you do though, Try
   ctrl + c to stop the program.)

3) Change the third condition to increment by more or less than one.
