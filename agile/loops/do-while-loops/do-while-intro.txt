This next program will use a do while loop.
Do While loops are different than for loops because they
run while a condition is met or unmet, whereas for loops
iterate a predetermined amount of time. A Do While loop is 
different than standard While loops because they will 
always run at least one time.

Let's practice by writing out a while loop.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class DoWhileIntro {
    public static void main( String args[] ) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        char ch;

        do {
            System.out.print( "Press a key followed by ENTER: " );
            ch = keyboard.next().charAt(0);
        } while(ch != 'q');
    }
}

What now?

Can you change the loop so that it only runs while the user inputs
'q'?
