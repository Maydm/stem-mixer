If you made it through the previous lesson on operations then you should
have a solid understanding of how we can use Java to compute mathematical
operations. Now we'll combine our knowledge of variables, operations and inputs
to create a program that accepts numbers as an input, calculates operations
behind the scenes and returns answers, or an output to the user. 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class VarsAndOperations {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a, b, i, n;
        double x, y, p, doubleA, doubleB;
        String first, second, third, name, two, all;
        
        System.out.println( "Let's play with numbers!" );
        System.out.print( "Please provide a whole number (an integer) " );
        a = keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print( "Thanks! Let me have another integer, please. " );
        b = keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println( "Awesome. So the first number is " + a );
        System.out.println( "And the second number is " + b );
        
        System.out.println( "So " + a + " plus " + b + " is equal to " + (a + b) );
        System.out.println( a + " minus " + b + " is equivalent to " + (a - b) );
        System.out.println( "and the product of " + a + " multiplied by " + b + " equals " + (a * b) );
        doubleA = a; // We're converting the integer into a variable that can hold a decimal
        doubleB = b;
        p = doubleB / doubleA;  // var p is a double which can hold a decimal number
        System.out.println( b + " divided by " + a + " returns " + (b / a) );
        System.out.println( "If b/a returned '0' that's because the dividend is less than zero." );
        System.out.println( "The answer you're looking for is: " + p );
        
        System.out.println( "Finally, " + a + " modulus " + b + " outputs " + (a % b) );
        
        System.out.println( "That was fun. Let's play with decimals now." );
        System.out.print( "Offer me any number with a decimal, but keep it to seven digits max. " );
        x = keyboard.nextDouble();
        System.out.print( "Great. Now I need one more decimal number. " );
        y = keyboard.nextDouble();
        System.out.println( "OK. So we have " + x + " and " + y + ". Let's math!" );
        
        System.out.println( x + " plus " + y + " = " + (x + y) );
        System.out.println( x + " plus " + y + " plus " + a + " = " + (x + y + a) );
        System.out.println( y + " minus " + b + " = " + (y - b) );
        System.out.println( x + " times " + y + " minus " + b + " = " + ((x * y) - b) );
        System.out.println( y + " divided by " + x + " plus " + a + " modulus " + b + " = " + (((y / x) + a) % b) );
        
        System.out.println( "That was interesting. Let's play with concatonation now." );
        System.out.println( "Let's make a new superhero name for you." );
        System.out.print( "What's your favorite color? " );
        first = keyboard.next();
        System.out.print( "What's your favorite season of the year? " );
        second = keyboard.next();
        System.out.print( "Enter an adjective. That's a descriptive word such as 'big', 'fast', 'short', or 'silent' " );
        third = keyboard.next();
        System.out.print( "Finally, we need a noun. " );
        name = keyboard.next();
        
        System.out.println( "Your new superhero name is: The " + third + " " + first + " " + second + " " + name + "!" );
        System.out.println( "That's a long name. The short version is " + third + " " + name + "." );
        
        System.out.println( "We can make this name easier to return in the future." );
        all = third + " " + first + " " + second + " " + name;
        two = third + " " + name;
        
        System.out.println( "Now when you want to use your full name call the variable all: " + all );
        System.out.println( "Or call variable two for the nickname: " + two );
    }
}


Wow! That was a lot. Pat yourself on the back once you've successfully complied and ran the code.
Your brain may be tired now, and it has worked hard. You should have learned quite a bit here about
how we can string operations together and concatonate words. You even converted an integer to a double!

Now that you've conquered this, what would happen if you concatonated without the " " spaces inbetween the
superhero names? Let's try it and see.

What would happen if we concatonated the integer and double variables? Let's try that too.

What if we ignore the computer instructions and use numbers instead of letters for the superhero name?
